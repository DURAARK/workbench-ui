The WorkbenchUI is a graphical user interface demonstrating the functionality of the [DURAARK System](https://github.com/DURAARK/duraark-platform-api/), which consists of multiple components tailored for long-term archival of architectural data (the main purpose of the [DURAARK](http://duraark.eu) project).

The WorkbenchUI is tying together a bunch of microservices which provide functionality for long-time archival of architectural data. We envision to provide a 'living archive' for building data where multiple stakeholders from the AEC community are provided with a coherent user interface for performing use cases within the domain.

## Demo-Server

A showcasing demo is running on or [development system](http://juliet.cgv.tugraz.at). It is a development system, not a production one. You will always have the newest version running there, but it is also possible to experience bugs. A production demo will be available soon at http://workbench.duraark.eu. Currently we have the first prototype version running there.

## Setup & Installation

The deployment setup is based on the repository [microservice-base](https://github.com/DURAARK/microservice-base). It provides development scripts and docker deployment. Have a look at the link to get more detailed information.

Enjoy!
